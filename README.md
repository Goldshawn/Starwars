This is the a starwars repo by a starwars fan. The application supports iOS 13 and above. Users can use this app to view the planets and some of the people attached to the Starwars world. The likes of Anakin, Darth Vader, (Anakin again cause he is so cool).

## Features

- Connects to API
- Display planets
- Display Characters
- Display some character images
- Interactive onboarding screen for iOS 14 and higher users

The connection to the api NetworkService was unit tested same as the viewmodel controling the server information. 
We do not believe in unit testing the Views... Basically stats padding

Have fun testing the application.
